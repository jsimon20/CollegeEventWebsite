Download WAMP (Windows) or MAMP (MAC)

cd into your WAMP or MAMP file to get to htdocs ex: /Applications/MAMP/htdocs

Do the following command inside the htdocs folder:
git clone https://github.com/jsimon20/CollegeEventWebsite.git

The repo already has index.php inside so you can delete the default index.php in your htdocs folder
